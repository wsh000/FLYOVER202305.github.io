ADST ( Autonomous Driving Simulation Test ) focuses on autonomous driving-related testing and simulation technologies. Alibaba's self-driving lab is cooperating with well-known universities at home and abroad to research autonomous driving technology. The current research directions are as follows:


* Autonomous driving data mining and clustering


* Simulation scenario modeling and generation


* Safety scenario analysis and reconstruction


* Fault injection and adversarial attacks


* Accelerated longtail scenario generation


* Interactive scenario generation


We sincerely welcome more scholars to join our research work . 


TEAM COOPERATION
======

Alibaba Autonomous Driving Lab, Nanyang Technological University and Tianjin University are collaborating on autonomous driving technology with the aim of developing reliable, interpretable and verifiable autonomous simulation data solutions. The main cooperation teams are as follows:

INDUSTRY INFLUENCE
======

* 2022 "TIANCHI" SIMULATION COMPETITION  

<img src = "../images/bisaihaibao.jpg"   width = 800>     

The first high-speed autonomous driving simulation Challenge in China, relying on the powerful Ali Cloud infrastructure "Cloud efficient car training", attracted more than 1,500 teams to participate, with master and Bo accounting for 15% and C9 universities accounting for 56%. One of the top judges in the autonomous driving industry and a number of professors from prestigious universities.

* DATA SET:MATRIX FLYOVER

Matrix Flyover(High precision map simulation data set of high-speed hubs in China),Developed by Alibaba and Nanyang Technological in Singapore. In view of the large amount of testing required for 160,000 km expressway in China and the high cost of high-precision map generation, it is difficult to solve the problem of test generalization. The simulation map data set of high-speed hub is constructed based on simulation generation.

At present, there are 1443 HD Maps, based on Hangzhou real data generalization generation, support mainstream formats (open drive & sumo & apollo), parameter sampling and generalization in line with highway junction design specifications. This Dataset filled the gap of the lack of real and high precision and generalization of hdmap in the industry, and provided the basis for the subsequent map-based construction of more abundant scene library and related automatic driving research. The relevant results were published in the robot top meeting ICRA 2023,[See details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12738).

      HDMapNet is an online HD map learning framework, which dynamically constructs HD maps based on onboard sensor observations. It is a more scalable way to provide semantic and geometry priors to self-driving vehicles than traditional pre-annotated HD maps.
